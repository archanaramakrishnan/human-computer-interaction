# Human Computer Interaction Project: Happy Earth
For a human computer interaction class, my team and I created a prototype of a recycling app for the Next Billion Users.

[Link to slides of the design thinking process of building the prototype](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CFnoWWB_6tVOcFffiAInhUjaOX6RYqDAmgqUso111MI/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
